After the 2019 setback, Kalyan and JSP focused on highlighting issues like farmer welfare, transparent governance, poor infrastructure, illegal sand mining, women's safety, land encroachment etc. On 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers, against YSR Congress Party, who have been facing unemployment due to a shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh.[180] On 16 January 2020, Kalyan announced his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from it.[181] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[182] He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[183] In late 2022, Kalyan started 'Jana Vani,' a series of small public meetings to hear people's grievances. In 2023, he launched a state-wide yatra in his customized vehicle 'Varahi,' aimed at strengthening the party's connection with the voters.[37]

In the 2024 General and state Assembly elections, Kalyan played a key role in forging an alliance between JSP, TDP and BJP by limiting the number of seats his party contested. The alliance swept to power in a landslide victory, with Jana Sena winning each of the seats it contested — 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats. Kalyan was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Pitapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes.[37]
